Description: 
    The DAssemble package implements an ensemble framework for differential-abundance
    and differential-expression analysis across bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq,
    and microbiome studies. It wraps a collection of popular DA/DE methods as core
    methods and combines them via Cauchy Combination Tests (CCT), optionally
    augmented by simple enhancers such as Wilcoxon, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, and
    presence–absence logistic regression.
